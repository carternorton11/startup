### Tour Pal

My friends and I have often struggled to decide where to go backcountry skiing. With hundreds of options on the Wasatch Front,
we rarely start with the same ideas about where to go, and we have to go through a messy process of explaining our ideas and 
justifying our choice. With TourPal, friends can pick a date to go skiing, and each can nominate locations, entering in key 
information like approach distance, aspect, and vertical feet.

#Push and Pull
Github allows for easy version/source control across multiple devices and users
Visual Studio code has built in tools that interface with Github, allowing you to manage source control of your projects directly from your IDE!
To commit edits: simply press "CMD Enter" while highlighting whatever you have changed
To push edits: select the source control button on the left side, then enter a update message and click the check mark to send edits through

If you have merge problems when pulling from GitHub, use the built in merge resolver to resolve the conflicting changes.
